## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a big one for learning how to use transitions as well as creating flippable elements. I still have a ways to go with it, but I'm happy with my first shot at this flipcard animation. Also picked up a few nuances with JS with setInterval and setTimeout which will come in handy on future projects.

### Continued development

I hope to get better at transitions in further projects. I also wish to come back to this one and maybe trying to get the flip animation a bit better with animations instead.
